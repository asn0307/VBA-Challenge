Homework 2 - VBA Challenge
Code was (somehow???) found when Googling a question on how to do something. Link used provided below:

I did update a few minor things, but for the most part used it. When in my tutoring session, my tutor instructed me to Google how to do something. That was when I found this.

Upon using the worksheet loop in that code, I found that I was getting an error - Error 28 - Out of Stack Space. Time was spent troubleshooting that, unsuccesfully. I used the code in the previous link, plus one from the below link. Same error in both.

I talked it out with a classmate and figured maybe a variable was set as an integer instead of long, that wasn't it. I gave up. My brain hurts and google wasn't helpful.
